In this workshop, I learned a lot about constructors, destructors, this object, input/output, member functions etc. I enjoy working with constructors because the more we go deep, the more I see how everything happens in the programming world. How we create an object and destroy it with a destructor amazes me. I felt like I learned something that not everyone knows! Classes are exciting with all their member functions, hidden variables, how we initialize values to that variables. I understand now everything more clear. I had a hard time with functions because I didn't give my char pointers as constants I was getting errors and warnings while compiling. I tried everything for hours till I went back to work, and I was in a rush because I'd got to finish the workshop before I went to work. I was so happy when I figured it out and finally finished the workshop. It took me a while to figure things out, but I learned a lot, and I'm so happy that my solution worked out.
