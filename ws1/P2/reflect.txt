/* 
->I started working on our first workshop whenever it was available because I like to be ahead of schedule.-> 
->Lab part of the workshop was easy, we learned modular design last semester with ipc144, and I re-design the->
-> code as mentioned in the workshop details. I don't recall if there was something that I already don't know->
-> in the first part. When it comes to the second part, called DIY The Phone Directory, to be honest, this part wasn't->
-> properly explained. I had a hard time understanding the details and what I needed to do. Because of this reason->
-> I had a hard time while planning. Because I had a hard time planning, after I finished coding, I realized that I haven't->
-> really finished part two. I couldn't understand that we had to check if the text file was there. The unsuccessful->
-> execution, I thought it was an instance of the wrongly coded program. I e-mailed Professor Liu and with his reply->
-> I finally understand that the unsuccessful execution was a part of our work. I ended up changing my code a bit->
-> by adding an if statement and used .is_open() function to check if the file is opened or not and wrote an error->
-> message if the file can not open. That was my struggle, and I couldn't understand the details because the workshop->
-> wasn't explained in detail, but I managed to finish on time.*/
